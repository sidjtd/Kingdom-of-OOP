# Kingdom of OOP

ES6 OOP Exercise

## Goal

Setup all required classes and subclasses of the animal kingdom.
Make tests pass.

## Setup project

### Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### Run tests

```bash
gulp
```

## Classes and Subclasses

all class files will be saved to the `lib/` subdirectory.
each class file will be named after it's class name, for example the `Protista` class will be saved in `lib/Protista.js`
each class file will define only one class, and export it as `default`

### LivingThing

#### constructor



defined with the following parameters
- name
- uniCellular
- trueNucleus
- anaerobic
- asexual
- mobile

declares and assigns the following private properties

- _name = name

- should have a method named `aerobic` that sets the value of the private property `_anaerobic`
- should have a method named `asexual` that returns a boolean value based on the private property `_asexual`
- should have a method named `asexual` that sets the value of the private property `_asexual`
- should have a method named `sexual` that returns a boolean value based on the private property `_asexual`
- should have a method named `sexual` that sets the value of the private property `_asexual`
- should have a method named `mobile` that returns a boolean value based on the private `_mobile`
- should have a method named `mobile` that sets the value of the private `_mobile`
- should have a method named `immobile` that returns a boolean value based on the private `
- should have a method named `immobile` that sets the value of the private `_mobile`

## When all tests pass

Play with instantiating objects in `./example/index.js`
there is one example of each class already written

```bash
gulp run
```
